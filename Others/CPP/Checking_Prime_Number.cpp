/*
Problem Idea:
Given an integer n, check each number from 1 to n to determine if it is a prime number.
A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
For each number in the range, print whether it is prime or not.

Input:
- A single integer n (1 â‰¤ n), representing the upper limit of the range to check.

Output:
- For each integer i from 1 to n, print "<i> is prime" if i is a prime number, or "<i> is not prime" if it is not.

Examples:
1. Input:
   5
   Output:
   1 is not prime
   2 is prime
   3 is prime
   4 is not prime
   5 is prime

2. Input:
   3
   Output:
   1 is not prime
   2 is prime
   3 is prime
